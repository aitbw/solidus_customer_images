# SolidusCustomerImages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nebulab/solidus_customer_images.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nebulab/solidus_customer_images)

Solidus extension that allows customers to upload their images, with admin moderation

## Installation

Add solidus_customer_images to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_customer_images'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_customer_images:install
```

## Setup frontend views

For a quick implementation you may prefer to use the included `Deface` overrides by customizing directives in [add_form_link_to_product_page.rb](https://github.com/nebulab/solidus_customer_images/blob/master/app/overrides/add_form_link_to_product_page.rb) setting `disabled: false`.

For a more fine grained implementation you can rewrite `Deface` injected partials according to needs and use them directly in views as you prefer.
See [add_form_link_to_product_page.rb](https://github.com/nebulab/solidus_customer_images/blob/master/app/overrides/add_form_link_to_product_page.rb) for details.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake test_app # generates the dummy app
bundle exec rake # runs rubocop and rspec
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_customer_images/factories'
```
